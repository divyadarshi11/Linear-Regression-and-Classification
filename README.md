# Linear-Regression-and-Classification
*************How to Execute******************

Use any IDE (Jupyter, Pycharm) or execute through cmd by using command "python3 <Filename>.py"

1. For Linear Regression, to run the first model:
	->python train_regression1.py
   This will plot the graph and also save the model.
	->python eval_regression1.py
   This will display the MSE values.
   Similarly run other models.
     
****Run this file ->train_regressionL2.py*****
This will display the the difference in parameters between the regularized and non-regularized model.

****Run this file ->regression_mult_output.py*****
Regression with Multiple Outputs, this will display MSE for training set and test set.

2. For Logistic Regression,
	->python LogisticRegression.py
   Then,->eval_classifier1.py ->eval_classifier2.py  ->eval_classifier3.py

3. For Linear Discriminant Analysis,
	->python LinearDiscriminantAnalysis.py 
   Then,->eval_classifier4.py ->eval_classifier5.py  ->eval_classifier6.py
